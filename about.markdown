I was born and raised in Arequipa, Peru. For most of my life, sports were my priority; however, my main focus now is my studies.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Human Medicine in 2023. I am now a licensed physician in Peru and currently completing my SERUMS at the Salinas Moche Health Post, where I work as both a physician and the head of the facility. I started this job in May 2024 and will complete it in April 2025.

## Things I am Working On

- SERUMS Physician (2024-I) and Head of Facility at the Salinas Moche Health Post.

Additionally, I have web design skills, including building my personal website with Jekyll. My main projects are available on my [GitHub: danimedi](https://github.com/danimedi).
- **Teaching**: I enjoy sharing what I learn with others. I believe that research and software development can help solve problems, which motivates me to create and share my work. I share what I learn through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danimedi555) and my [personal website](https://danimedi.com).
- **Sports**: Sports were a central part of my life for a long time; although not as much now, I still stay active. I practice various sports, including cycling, soccer, athletics, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, and others.
- **Literature**: I enjoy reading and writing. On my blog, I write short stories, poems, and other texts where I express my ideas and feelings. I also enjoy reading literature books, though I admit I sometimes don't dedicate as much time to it as I would like.
- **Learning languages and other subjects**: I have a strong inclination to learn new things. Besides Spanish and English, I also regularly use Portuguese. As a child, I studied French and Mandarin Chinese, though I no longer practice them. I have a broad interest in learning new topics, with a particular interest in philosophy, economics, geography, and politics. However, biology, astronomy, history, and many other subjects also capture my attention.
