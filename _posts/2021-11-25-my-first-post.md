This is my first post of the website, so this is a big deal for me, because this is the first time I do a lot of things, the first time I have a website, the first time I write a blog, the first time I publicly present myself, the first time I write something in English publicly. A big step indeed.

I hope this will be the first of many posts, and I will continue improving my website, my writing skills, trying to make less mistakes, and many other things. So, I see this as the beginning of a journey and a part of the long journey of my life.

However, I keep wondering if it is better to have this website in English or Spanish.
